<h1>Svelte Inview</h1>
<p>
  A Svelte action that monitors an element enters or leaves the viewport/parent
  element. Performant and efficient thanks to using Intersection Observer under
  the hood. Can be used in multiple projects including lazy loading images,
  infinite scrolling, playing/pausing the video when in the viewport, tracking
  user behaviour firing link pre-fetching and animations and many many more.

    Why bother?
👓️ Watch for any element that enters or leaves the viewport (or another wrapper/parent element).
🏎️ Thanks to using Intersection Observer, Svelte Inview is blazing fast and doesn't block the main thread.

🎛️ Use it in several different scenarios such as lazy loading images, infinite scrolling, playing/pausing the video when in the viewport, firing link pre-fetching, animations and many many more.
🐥 Easy to use API.
↕️ Detects the scrolling direction.
